# AGENTS.md — Developer & AI-Assistant Reference

## Project Summary

MNESIS is a recurrent spiking neural network (SNN) with heterogeneous synaptic
delays. The repository has two independent, buildable halves:

- **`src/`** — Python source and Jupyter experiment notebooks. Core code lives in
  two modules (`mnesis_boilerplate.py`, `mnesis_chains.py`); the numbered
  notebooks import from them and are run sequentially.
- **`tex/`** — LaTeX source of the paper (`Perrinet26mnesis.tex`), a small set of
  standalone TikZ figures, a bibliography, and the Springer LNCS class/style files.

This file gives **rules, commands, and gotchas** for agents working in the
repository; it is not a place for reference data. The full parameter catalogue,
per-experiment results, and notebook inventory live in `README.md` — point there
for "what value / what result", and to the paper (`tex/Perrinet26mnesis.pdf`) for
the camera-ready numbers.

An AI assistant was used to improve the readability of the code, not to create
it; these rules guide how that formatting and testing was done.

## Architecture Overview

### Module Dependency Graph (`src/`)

```
notebooks (*.ipynb)
   └── mnesis_chains.py         (HD_SNN, SpikingPattern, StochasticSpikingPattern, load())
         └── mnesis_boilerplate.py    (imports, Params dataclass, utilities, SpikeF1scoreLoss)
               └── snntorch / torch / numpy / matplotlib / ...
```

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/mnesis_boilerplate.py` | Entry-point imports (torch, snntorch, …), device auto-detection (MPS → CUDA → CPU), `Params` dataclass (single source of hyperparameter truth), utilities (`flip_bits`, `printfig`, `get_scores`, `SpikeF1scoreLoss`, cosine LR schedule). |
| `src/mnesis_chains.py` | Pattern generators (`SpikingPattern`, `StochasticSpikingPattern`) and the `HD_SNN` class (`forward_pass`, `get_W_init`, `update_weight`, `learn_model`); also a `load()` helper for trained checkpoints. |

Notebooks (`src/*.ipynb`) are numbered simple → complex, each loading cached
artifacts from the previous one. They **import** from the two modules — they do
**not** carry standalone copies of `Params`, `HD_SNN`, etc. Notebooks 01, 05, and
08 (former `boilerplate`, `parameters`, `generative-model`) were refactored into
the two modules; any reference to those notebook numbers in old documents is stale.

## `src/` — Python source code

### Install

```bash
pip install -r src/requirements.txt     # Python 3.10+; toolchain lives in .venv/
```

### Conventions

- Imports belong at the top of `mnesis_boilerplate.py`; downstream modules and
  notebooks re-export via `from mnesis_boilerplate import …`.
- Notebooks `from mnesis_boilerplate import …` / `from mnesis_chains import …`, so
  they must be **run from inside `src/`** (that is the expected CWD).
- `src/mnesis_boilerplate.py` `Params` is the authoritative hyperparameter source.
- `.venv/` is git-ignored; do not commit it.
- Figure/sandbox output goes to `../figures/` (relative to `src/`); on the Jean Zay
  cluster (`USER == "uvb28bo"`) figure saving is disabled automatically.
- `datetag` controls the cache-filename prefix — change it to start a new batch
  (current run: `2026-09-07`).
- `seed = 2026` (in `Params`) is fixed for reproducibility.

### Debug mode

Set `DEBUG > 1` in `mnesis_boilerplate.py` to shrink the problem: `N_neuron`,
`N_pattern`, `N_time`, and `num_epochs` are divided by `DEBUG`. Use `DEBUG = 1` (the
default) only for production/camera-ready runs.

### Cache invalidation

Artifacts are cached in `cached_data/` (git-ignored). To recompute:
- delete the individual `.pth`, `.json`, `.npz`, or `.sqlite3` file, or
- set `RECOMPUTE = True` at the top of the notebook to invalidate the whole cache.

**File-based locking** (used by the scan/optimisation notebooks): a `.lock`
sentinel file guards against concurrent runs of the same scan.
1. If `RECOMPUTE=True`, delete both the data and lock files to force a restart.
2. Load existing results if present.
3. If no lock file exists, create one and start processing.
4. For each parameter value, skip it if already computed; otherwise run the scan and append to the JSON.
5. Delete the lock file when done.
This avoids data corruption and allows safe incremental resumption — never delete
a `.lock` out from under a running scan.

### Test / compile the Python side

There is **no unit-test framework** (no pytest/CI). The checks below *are* the
tests; run the fast one first, then a representative notebook, and only the full
orchestrator when you need end-to-end verification.

```bash
cd src

# 1. Fast: modules import and build cleanly
python -c "import mnesis_boilerplate, mnesis_chains"

# 2. Representative: execute the smallest notebook (set DEBUG > 1 in mnesis_boilerplate.py first)
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace 10_MNESIS_generative-model.ipynb

# 3. Full pipeline (slow): the orchestrator runs the whole notebook chain
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace 99_MNESIS_run-all.ipynb
```

`nbconvert` exiting without error and writing updated outputs is a green build.

## `tex/` — LaTeX source code

### Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Perrinet26mnesis.tex` | Main paper. `\input{metadata}` + biblatex (`\addbibresource{mnesis.bib}`, `\printbibliography`). Uses `fontspec` — **must be built with `lualatex`**, not `pdflatex`. |
| `metadata.tex` | `\input` fragment (author/affiliation/AI-statement macros); **no** `\documentclass`, do not compile standalone. |
| `fig_izhikevich.tex`, `fig_snntorch.tex` | Standalone TikZ figures (`\documentclass{standalone}`); compiled to their own PDFs in `tex/`. |
| `figure_*.tex` | `\input` figure environments (caption + `\label`) whose graphics come from `../figures/` (e.g. `figure_target.tex` → `fig:target`, `figure_robustness.tex` → `fig:noise`). |
| `mnesis.bib` | Bibliography database. |

The main paper resolves experiment figures through `\graphicspath{{../figures/}}`
(`Perrinet26mnesis.tex:40`): `pattern.pdf`, `target.pdf`, `retrieval.pdf`, the
`*_score.pdf` curves, etc. are **generated by the `src/` notebooks**, not built in
`tex/`. The two TikZ figures are built in `tex/`. Build everything from inside
`tex/`. Engine is `lualatex` (fontspec); toolchain: `lualatex`, `latexmk -pdflua`,
`biber`.

### Test / compile the LaTeX side

Full build (reproduces `tex/Perrinet26mnesis.pdf`):

```bash
cd tex

# 1. Standalone TikZ figures
lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode fig_izhikevich.tex
lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode fig_snntorch.tex

# 2. Experiment figures — must already exist in ../figures/
#    generate them by running the relevant notebooks in src/ (see above), e.g.
cd ../src && jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace 11_MNESIS_learn-synthetic.ipynb && cd ..

# 3. Build the paper (biber handled automatically by latexmk)
cd tex && latexmk -pdflua -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode Perrinet26mnesis.tex
```

If latexmk refuses ("gave an error in previous invocation"), `latexmk -g` or run
`lualatex` twice directly. Quick, figure-independent parse check (tolerates
missing `../figures/*.pdf`):

```bash
cd tex && lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode Perrinet26mnesis.tex
```

A clean run produces `tex/Perrinet26mnesis.pdf`. (A `Missing character: ^^V
(U+0016)` warning from the `dsrom`/microtype font is a benign known quirk, not a
control character in the sources.) Generated byproducts
(`.aux`, `.bbl`, `.blg`, `.log`, `.fls`, `.fdb_latexmk`, `.synctex.gz`, and the
`Perrinet26mnesis_copy.tex*` scratch copy) are git-ignored — never commit them.

## Notebook annotations

Each experiment notebook carries markdown documentation in a standard shape
(see notebooks 10–16 for models to follow):

- **H1 title** (`# ...`) as the first markdown cell, stating the experiment in
  one paragraph; end it with the `<!-- MNESIS-annotated -->` idempotency marker
  so annotation passes are not applied twice.
- **`## Notebook summary`** with exactly three `###` sub-sections:
  `### Pipeline` (numbered stages), `### Main outputs` (caches + figures),
  `### Notes` (gotchas; keep known bugs flagged here rather than silently
  fixing scan cells).
- One **`##` header per experimental stage** (`## Parameters`,
  `## Analytic initialisation of the readout`, `## Supervised learning of the
  readout`, `## Sweep: ...`), with `###` for raster legends, evaluation cells
  and animations. Match the heading style already used in 30/40-series
  notebooks (`## working memory with periodic targets`).
- Inline `#` code comments may be added, but **commenting must never change
  executable code** (verify by stripping comments and diffing against HEAD).

**Terminology (consistency with the paper):**

| Prefer | Avoid |
|---|---|
| *motif* (a stored spiking pattern, `N_pattern` of them) | "pattern" when referring to what is memorised |
| *trigger window* (first `num_delay` ms, clamped input) | "cue", "prompt" |
| *replay* / *re-emit* | "output the duration" |
| *evoked window* = `spikes[:, :, N_pretime+num_delay : N_time+N_pretime]` vs `target[:, :, num_delay:]` | ad-hoc scoring slices |
| *spiking motif (SM) window* for the `num_delay`-wide history | "stimulus window" |

**Raster legend (used by every retrieval notebook):** green `x` = input spikes
(spontaneous pad + trigger), open red `o` = target (hidden from the network
after the trigger), blue `+` = evoked/replayed spikes; red/blue dashed vlines
mark `N_pretime` and `N_pretime + num_delay`. The paper captions in
`figure_*.tex` use the same colours — keep both sides in sync when changing a
plot.

**Figures → generating notebook:**

| figure | notebook |
|---|---|
| `frozen`, `two_ssp` | 10 |
| `pattern`, `target_init`, `target` | 11 |
| `retrieval` (+ `.mp4`) | 13 |
| `p_flip_target`, `p_flip_score`, `p_flip_retrain_score` | 14 |
| `trigger_time`, `trigger_time_score` | 15 |
| `fraction_target`, `fraction_target_score` | 16 |

**Character hygiene:** no non-breaking/narrow spaces (U+00A0/U+202F), zero-width
characters, curly quotes or non-ASCII hyphens in `.py`, `.ipynb`, `.tex`
comments/docstrings — use plain ASCII there (legitimate em/en dashes in README
prose are fine). The `^^V (U+0016)` lualatex warning is the `dsrom` font quirk,
not a stray character.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Parameter drift.** As of the reconciliation run `2026-09-07`, the paper
  methods text (β = 0.7, τ ≈ 2.8 steps; ϑ₀ = 0.75, δ = 0.25; p_flip = 0.01;
  FastSigmoid α = 5; adadelta; η 40→0.4 mLR; dropout 0.6) matches the
  `Params` production defaults in `mnesis_boilerplate.py`. Older documents
  may still cite camera-ready values (β = 0.8, α = 12, SGD, dropout 0.10);
  robustness results (Fig. `fig:noise`) keep their own run's numbers. **Do not
   "autocorrect" code defaults to match stale prose** — consult `README.md` /
   `tex/Perrinet26mnesis.pdf` for the exact value a given figure used.
  Each notebook may also override defaults with its own local `opt_dict`.
- **Bibliography toolchain.** The paper and poster `.tex` files were migrated from `natbib`/`bibtex` to `biblatex`/`biber` (updates to `Perrinet26mnesis.tex` and `Perrinet26mnesis_poster.tex`: replace `\usepackage{natbib}` with `\usepackage[style=numeric, sorting=none]{biblatex}` + `\addbibresource{mnesis.bib}`, and replace `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}\bibliography{mnesis}` with `\addbibresource{mnesis.bib}\printbibliography`; bibliography line `%!BIB TS-program = bibtex` → `%!BIB TS-program = biber). Do not revert these changes.
- The analytical initialisation in `HD_SNN.get_W_init` is controlled by two flags:
  `do_pinv` (default `True`; `False` switches to the Hebbian cross-correlation rule)
  and `do_deconv` (default `True`; LIF-membrane deconvolution of the target).
- `num_delay` must stay **odd** (convolution symmetry).
- Keep notebooks' shared code **in the two modules**, not inlined — notebooks are
  meant to stay import-only.
