> **MNESIS** — *Memory Network Every Spike Is Sacred*

This repository contains the full implementation, experiments, and paper source for **MNESIS**, a recurrent spiking neural network (SNN) with heterogeneous synaptic delays that stores and recalls arbitrary spike patterns as sequential chains of overlapping Spiking Motifs.

---

## Overview

Working memory in biological neural circuits relies on precise spike timing rather than sustained firing rates. MNESIS models this by equipping every synapse with $D$ learnable delays, parameterised as a single weight tensor $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N \times D}$. Each stored pattern is encoded as a chain of overlapping **Spiking Motifs**: contiguous context windows of length $D$ that uniquely predict the next time step of activity. A closed-form initialisation derived by deconvolving the LIF membrane response reaches near-perfect recall before any gradient step, while surrogate-gradient BPTT then adds robustness to noise.

The same `HD_SNN` framework is applied across a growing zoo of pattern families: sparse synthetic motifs, periodic motifs, structured travelling waves, chaotic (Lorenz) trajectories, a tokenised text corpus, and real spiking data (Spiking Heidelberg Digits). The experiments below build on one another: each numbered notebook imports the shared infrastructure and loads the cached artifacts produced by the previous one.

## Quickstart

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

Core dependencies: `torch`, `snntorch`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `jupyter`. The text experiment additionally uses the `datasets` and `tiktoken` packages, and the optimisation/scan notebooks use `optuna` (all bundled in `requirements.txt`).

### Run the notebooks in order

The notebooks are numbered and designed to be run sequentially. They import shared infrastructure from the Python modules `mnesis_boilerplate.py` (imports, device detection, `Params` dataclass, utilities) and `mnesis_chains.py` (`HD_SNN` class, pattern generators, analytical initialisation). Each notebook saves its outputs (model weights, scan results) to `cached_data/` so that downstream notebooks can load them without recomputation. Notebook 99 can orchestrate a full multi-notebook run in one place.

```bash
cd src
jupyter notebook
```

Each notebook opens with its own `opt_dict = dict(...)` that overrides the global `Params`
defaults for that experiment (a different `N_neuron`, `num_delay`, `N_pretime`, threshold, …).
The global defaults in `Params` are the canonical reference; per-notebook `opt_dict`s tune the
run for the pattern family being studied.

| # | Notebook / Module | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|
| — | `mnesis_boilerplate.py` | Shared imports, device detection (MPS / CUDA / CPU), random-seed utilities, `Params` dataclass, and helper functions reused by all downstream notebooks. |
| — | `mnesis_chains.py` | Defines `SpikingPattern`, `StochasticSpikingPattern`, and the `HD_SNN` class with analytical weight initialisation (a pseudo-inverse or Hebbian cross-correlation, optionally deconvolving the LIF membrane). Corresponds to the Methods section of the paper. |
| 10 | `10_MNESIS_generative-model.ipynb` | Implements the generative model for synthetic sparse patterns: draws Gaussian logit maps $\ell \sim \mathcal{N}(0, E_\mathrm{SM})$, thresholds to keep the top $p_\mathrm{SM}$ fraction, convolves with the biphasic spike shape, and samples Bernoulli spike trains at rate $p_A$. Visualises the resulting patterns. |
| 11 | `11_MNESIS_learn-synthetic.ipynb` | Trains the network on $M = 16$ synthetic sparse patterns. Demonstrates that the analytical init alone reaches high $F_1$; gradient training with a cosine schedule then improves noise robustness. |
| 13 | `13_MNESIS_testing-inference.ipynb` | Concatenates all $M = 16$ patterns in sequence with $N_\mathrm{pretime} = 50$ steps of spontaneous inter-trial activity; evaluates sliding-window $F_1$ to confirm selective, cross-interference-free retrieval. |
| 14 | `14_MNESIS_testing-noise.ipynb` | Bit-flip noise on the trigger window ($p_\mathrm{flip} \in [0, 1]$). Quantifies attractor-like robustness; $F_1 = 0.967$ at $p_\mathrm{flip} = 0.25$. |
| 15 | `15_MNESIS_testing-trigger-duration.ipynb` | Truncated trigger window (0 to $D-1$ steps). Finds the minimum cue length for reliable recall; $F_1 = 0.862$ at 75% of $D$. |
| 16 | `16_MNESIS_testing-trigger-fraction.ipynb` | Partial neuron coverage (0 to $N$ neurons silenced in trigger). Perfect recall maintained with 87.5% of neurons active. |
| 20 | `20_MNESIS_scanning-parameters.ipynb` | Systematic one-at-a-time scans over $D$, $T$, $p_A$, $N$, $E_\mathrm{SM}$, $p_\mathrm{SM}$, and the new `do_pinv` / `do_deconv` flags, with $N_\mathrm{cv} = 10$ seeds. Produces the parameter-scan figures of the paper. |
| 25 | `25_MNESIS_optuna.ipynb` | Automated hyperparameter search with [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) over learning dynamics, thresholds, and regularisation. |
| 30 | `30_MNESIS_learn-periodic.ipynb` | Builds periodic targets, trains periodic memories, and evaluates retrieval robustness under increasing input noise. |
| 32 | `32_MNESIS_learn-travelling-waves.ipynb` | Introduces MotionClouds-based travelling-wave patterns and benchmarks retrieval with structured spatiotemporal motifs. |
| 34 | `34_MNESIS_learn-Lorenz-attractor.ipynb` | Encodes Lorenz chaotic trajectories into spike codes and evaluates memory recall on non-periodic continuous dynamics. |
| 36 | `36_MNESIS_learn-text.ipynb` | Tokenises a Wikipedia corpus (`tiktoken`, `cl100k_base`) into token IDs, builds a frequency-ordered **spike codebook** (most-frequent tokens get the sparsest neuron rows, minimising the Hamming distance), wraps it in a `TextSpikingPattern` generator, learns and recalls the resulting spike patterns, then decodes the output spikes back to text via the inverse codebook + tokenizer. Includes Optuna tuning and parameter scans. |
| 40 | `40_MNESIS_learn-SHD.ipynb` | Integrates Spiking Heidelberg Digits data loading/preprocessing for dataset-grounded experiments. |
| 99 | `99_MNESIS_run-all.ipynb` | Scripted orchestrator to run the full notebook pipeline with progress timestamps. |

### Cached data

Results are saved to `cached_data/` (excluded from git via `.gitignore`):

| File pattern | Content |
|---|---|
| `*_init.pth` | Analytically initialised weights (pseudo-inverse or Hebbian, deconvolved or not) |
| `*.pth` | Trained model weights after gradient steps |
| `*_scan_*.json` | Parameter sweep results (loss, precision, recall per condition) |
| `*_periodic-with-noise.npz` | Periodic-memory robustness curves across noise levels and time chunks |
| `*_TW_*.json` | Travelling-wave parameter scans |
| `*_lorenz_chaotic_*.json` | Lorenz-attractor scan and optimisation outputs |
| `wikipedia_dataset.parquet` | Downloaded Wikipedia corpus (text experiment) |
| `*_wikipedia_fr_token_ids.npy` | Token-ID array of the tokenised corpus |
| `*_codebook.pt` | Frequency-ordered token→neuron spike codebook |
| `*_optuna.sqlite3` | Optuna studies (synthetic, travelling-wave, Lorenz, text) |

Delete a cached `.pth`, `.json`, `.npz`, or `.sqlite3` file to force recomputation; set `RECOMPUTE = True` at the top of any notebook to invalidate the full cache for that notebook. The scan/optimisation notebooks additionally guard each run with a `.lock` sentinel file to allow safe incremental resumption.

## Model

### Membrane dynamics

Each neuron $j$ evolves as:

$$u_j(t) = \beta \cdot u_j(t-1) \cdot (1 - s_j(t-1)) + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{d=1}^{D} W_{j,i,d} \cdot s_i(t-d)$$

The global `Params` defaults in the current `datetag` use $\beta = 0.8$ and threshold
$\vartheta = 0.72$; individual experiments override these in their local `opt_dict`
(e.g. the text and travelling-wave runs use other $\beta$ / $\vartheta$ pairs). `Params`
is the single source of hyperparameter truth; see the "Parameter drift" note below for
why the prose, the paper, and the code need not always agree.

### Analytical initialisation

The LIF membrane is a causal IIR lowpass. Two orthogonal flags control the closed-form
initialisation in `HD_SNN.get_W_init()`:

- **`do_deconv`** (default `True`) — deconvolve the membrane so the input current that
  drives neuron $j$ to a target spike at time $t$ is

  $$I^*_j(t) = \vartheta_0 \bigl(s^*_j(t) - \beta \cdot s^*_j(t-1)\bigr).$$

  With `do_deconv = False` the raw target $s^*_j(t)$ is used directly.

- **`do_pinv`** (default `True`) — solve for $\mathbf{W}$ via the (numerically stable,
  computed on CPU) full pseudo-inverse $\mathbf{W} = \mathrm{pinv}(\mathbf{C})\,\mathbf{T}$.
  With `do_pinv = False` a Hebbian cross-correlation rule is used instead, relying on the
  Gram-matrix approximation $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{C}^\top \approx N D p_A \mathbf{I}$:

  $$w_{i,j,d} = \frac{1}{N \cdot D \cdot p_A \cdot M} \sum_{\mu,\,t} s_i^{*(\mu)}(t-d) \cdot \bigl(s_j^{*(\mu)}(t) - \beta \cdot s_j^{*(\mu)}(t-1)\bigr).$$

  (When `do_pinv = False` this is the form quoted in the paper; the Gram-matrix
  approximation makes the cross-correlation rule exact.) The default `do_pinv = True`
  path is the most accurate and is what the camera-ready runs use.

### Training

- **Loss**: $\mathcal{L} = 1 - F_1$ (harmonic mean of precision and recall, evaluated after the trigger window) — `SpikeF1scoreLoss`
- **Optimiser**: SGD by default (`sgd`), configurable via `Params.optimizer` (also supports `adam`, `adamw`, `rmsprop`, `adadelta`)
- **Schedule**: cosine decay with a `num_warmup_epochs` warmup ramp (`final_lr` → `base_lr`)
- **Surrogate**: fast sigmoid by default, sharpness $\alpha = 5.0$ — configurable via `Params.surrogate_name` / `Params.alpha_surrogate`
- **Regularisation**: dropout $p = 0.25$, weight decay $\lambda = 0$
- **LIF dynamics**: $\beta = 0.8$, $\vartheta = 0.72$, zero-reset (`subtract`)
- **Hardware**: Apple M3 Ultra (MPS) or NVIDIA GPU (CUDA / Jean Zay GENCI)

> **Parameter drift.** The `Params` defaults are the *latest camera-ready run* (the current
> `datetag`, `2026-08-06`) and have moved on from the values in the paper text and earlier
> revisions of this README (notably $\beta$: `0.8` vs `0.7`; $\vartheta$: `0.72` vs `1.0`;
> $\alpha$: `5.0` vs `15`; dropout `0.25` vs `0.37`). Each notebook also sets its own
> `opt_dict`. The code (and this table) is authoritative for *what the current default run
> does*; consult the specific `opt_dict` and `tex/Perrinet26mnesis.pdf` for the exact value
> a given paper figure used.
